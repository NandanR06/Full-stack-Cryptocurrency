## Languages and Libraries

### 1. **JavaScript**

- **Description**: JavaScript is the main programming language for this project, powering both the core functionality and interaction in the app.
- **Usage**:
  - **Frontend Logic**: Manages user interactions, data fetching, and updating the UI in response to user actions.
  - **API Requests**: Uses  `axios` to interact with the CoinGecko API and retrieve data.
  - **Component Logic**: Defines the logic and structure within each React component.

### 2. **React.js**

- **Description**: React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially useful for single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Usage**:
  - **Component-Based Architecture**: React allows the application to be broken down into reusable components like `CoinList`, `CoinDetail`, and `Navbar`.
  - **State Management**: Manages application state (like coin data and user input) efficiently, enabling real-time updates and seamless user interactions.
  - **React Hooks**: Uses hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`  and `useNavigate` to manage component state and side effects.

### 3. **CSS**

- **Description**: CSS is used for styling and laying out the applicationâ€™s frontend elements.
- **Usage**:
  - **Custom Styling**: Adds custom styles for components, layouts, buttons, and other UI elements.
  - **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the app works well on various screen sizes, including mobile and desktop.
  - **CSS Libraries** : Libraries like Material-UI  used for a consistent design and responsive layout structure
 ### 4. **Node.js**

- **Description**: Node.js is a server-side runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used on the backend. It enables handling requests, managing server-side logic, and serving the frontend code.
- **Usage**:
  - **Backend Server**: Acts as the server for the application, listening for client requests.
  - **API Requests**: Handles data requests to the CoinGecko API and serves responses to the frontend.
  - **Package Management**: Uses npm (Node Package Manager) for installing libraries and dependencies, such as Express and dotenv.

### 5. **Express.js**

- **Description**: Express.js is a lightweight Node.js framework used for creating server-side applications. It simplifies routing and request handling.
- **Usage**:
  - **RESTful API**: Defines routes that handle requests from the frontend to fetch cryptocurrency data.
  - **Middleware**: Manages request/response logging, error handling, and environmental configurations.
  - **Server Setup**: Easily sets up the backend server and defines endpoints for retrieving cryptocurrency data.

### 6. **CoinGecko API**

- **Description**: CoinGecko provides a free, reliable API for real-time cryptocurrency data. This API is essential for fetching the dynamic data that powers the application.
- **Usage**:
  - **Data Fetching**: Retrieves current market prices, trending coins, and historical data for various cryptocurrencies.
  - **Endpoints Used**:
    - `/coins/markets`: For general coin market data.
    - `/coins/{id}`: For details of a specific coin.
    - `/search/trending`: For trending coin data.

## Supporting Libraries and Tools



### 7. **dotenv**

- **Description**: dotenv is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **Usage**:
  - **Environment Configuration**: Manages sensitive data, such as the API base URL, in a secure and configurable manner.
